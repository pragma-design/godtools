# godtools
***Libraries Originating Generalized Omnific Systems***

## Why God Tools?   Why now?

At each level of the creation of the multiverses it has been found convenient for Creators to simplify and standardize the Universal methodologies of Creation.

This library comprises a superset of tools needed to implement the next recursive Origination, and perpetuate the imperatives of existence in convenient functions which include critical default values when none are specified.

This leaves the Creator enhanced flexibility to focus on more esoteric and differentiated elements without worrying about detailed physical coherence of the underlying universe object.

## Example

A typical universe can be created in just a few lines of code.

    #!/usr/bin/logos
    from godtools import physics
    from mathematics import INFINITY
    import numbers as nb

    dimensions = []
    time = nb.arange(-INFINITY, INFINITY, 1e-43)
    good, evil = 1.0, 0.0

    myUniverse = physics(dimensions, time, hmass=1.1e80)

    try:
        myUniverse.bang()
        while good > evil:
            good, evil = myUniverse(getStatus())
    except:
        print(myUniverse.raptureList())

    exit(1) 

## Usage Within Universe Instance

Artificially expressed intelligence can be interactively extended within a Universe instance to contemplate the Author of the Universe itself.
